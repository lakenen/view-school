In this exercise, we used the `view` URL from the session response to show the document in an `iframe`. You might have noticed that the response actually contains three URLs: `view`, `assets`, and `realtime`. The `assets` URL is used with viewer.js, and we'll get to the `realtime` URL later in this workshop.

In the next lesson, we'll start working with viewer.js!
