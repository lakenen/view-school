# Lesson Twelve: Presentation Layout


## Your Task

In this exercise, you'll write a javascript module `presentation-viewer`:
- export a function that takes two arguments: an Element and string URL
- your function should create and `load()`, and return a viewer instance configured with the "presentation" layout
- use CSS to add page transitions to the viewer

Put your javascript solution in `presentation-viewer.js` in [this project's directory](/open/11-presentation-layout). The CSS will go in `transitions.css`.
