# Lesson One: Hello, View API

Welcome to View School!

View School is a *go-at-your-own-pace* workshop devoted to teaching you how to use [Box View](http://developers.box.com/view) and [viewer.js](https://github.com/box/viewer.js).

In this lesson, we'll get you setup with a brand new Box View API account.

## Your Task

1. [Create a Box account](https://box.com/developer_signup) (or [login](http://box.com/developers/services) if you already have one)
2. Once you're logged in, click "get started" to create a new Box application
3. Enter a name, select "Box View", and click "Create Application"
4. Click "Configure Your Application"
5. The "client_id" field is your View API token! Paste that token into `token.js` in [this project's directory](/open/00-hello-view-api).
