# Lesson Two: cURLing

[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) is a tool that allows you to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the command line.

In this exercise, we're going to upload a document to the View API by making a request with cURL. The URL you should use is:

<span style="word-break: break-all; font-size: 80%">`https://view-api.box.com/1/sessions/2dfb390dd1d84a11925cf44e9f2d5794/content`</span>

To get started, check out the "URL Upload" section of the [/documents POST documentation](http://developers.box.com/view/#post-documents).
