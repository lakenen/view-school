# Lesson One: cURLing

[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) is a tool that allows you to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the command line.

## Your Task

In this exercise, we're going to upload a document to the View API by making a request with cURL. The document URL you should use is:

<span style="word-break: break-all; font-size: 80%">`{{URL}}`</span>

You should make a POST request to `https://view-api.box.com/1/documents`.

Modify `upload.curl` in [this project's directory](/open/01-curling) with your solution.

To get started, check out the "URL Upload" section of the [/documents POST documentation](http://developers.box.com/view/#post-documents).
